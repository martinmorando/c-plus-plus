Very basic C++ implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe while learning the language. This code will be updated as I continue learning more about the syntax.

Ideas to implement:
- Accept multiple formats as input (1A, 1a, a1, A1)
- Check for winner after player1 moves
- Play n rounds, count points and determine winner
- Polish UI (for example, bigger game board and/or ASCII art)
- Rewrite getWinnerLetter() in a more concise way
- Determine randomly which player goes first (if users want)
- Comment more
- Test thoroughly
